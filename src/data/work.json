She wanted to rectify this problem by having a website built that showcased her work and impressive track record to potential customers. Claire wanted to ensure that her website was easy on the eye and had bespoke features which included an online quote form, careers page and a testimonal area which pulled in reviews from her Facebook page. From this, Claire saw an increase in enquiries in the services listed on her site.",

        "description": "AD Supplies is a relatively new business that has grown significantly without a website. David, one of the owners, wanted to continue the growth of the business and decided it would be best to have a website to point potential clients to. David also wanted a site which he could make amendments to and publish blog posts. I decided that WordPress was the solution for this and built a simple yet effective site, where SEO was one of the main focus points.",
