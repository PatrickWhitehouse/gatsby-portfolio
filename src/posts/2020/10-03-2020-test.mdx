Surprise surprise, 2020 meant it was time for another iteration of my portfolio. Working with Magento 2 day in day out meant my exposure to React was minimal. I decided to throw myself in the deep end and set myself a task of rebuilding my current portfolio in React. I had no idea where to start, however, I had previously used Jekyll to build a few small static sites. I decided to see if there was anything similar in the React world, and I came across Gatsby. 

Before I start any project, I always look for some form of motivation, just to see what is capable with the tools i'm looking to use. I had a flick through the Gatsby showcase and I was impressed with what has been built using Gatsby.
