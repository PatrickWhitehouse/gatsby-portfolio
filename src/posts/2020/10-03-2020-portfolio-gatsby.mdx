Surprise surprise, 2020 meant it was time for another iteration of my portfolio. Working with Magento 2 day in day out meant my exposure to React was minimal. I decided to throw myself in the deep end and set myself a task of rebuilding my current portfolio in React. I had no idea where to start, however, I had previously used Jekyll to build a few small static sites. I decided to see if there was anything similar in the React world, and I came across Gatsby. 

Before I start any project, I always look for some form of inspiration, just to see what is capable with the tools i'm looking to use. I had a flick through the Gatsby showcase and I was impressed with what has been built using Gatsby. 

Creating my portfolio in Gatsby has allowed me to get a deeper understanding of core ES6 features such as destructuring and the array methods (map, reduce, filter and sort). Map has been used quite a lot on this iteraiton of my portfolio, especially when I'm using graphql to query my data. 

One feature I love about Gatsby is the ability to create pages dynamically using the createPage API. Although I don't fully understand how this works (yet), I used Gatsby's docs to help me setup createPage to generate pages for my blogs, which are written in MDX. Gatsby's documentation is up there at the top of the leaderboard. 

This site is effortlessly hosted and deployed via Netlify. The second I make a change to my master branch on my GitHub repo, Netlify triggers the build and my changes are live within seconds.
